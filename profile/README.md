## Inspiration
As musicians, we feel that music production is a severely underrepresented niche in the field of machine learning and generative AI. We wanted to help supercharge artists by bringing the latest global revolution to your DAW.

## What it does
**Melodify** is a plugin for the music production software Ableton Live. We utilize the **Max for Live** platform along with the **Ableton Live API** to integrate seamlessly with your workflow and provide fresh melodic and harmonic ideas based on the context of the project. **Melodify** is made possible by streaming MIDI JSON data over UDP to and from an open source GenAI model hosted on **Hugging Face**. This is the heart of the entire platform, and after much fine tuning, works as the perfect digital musician's assistant.
